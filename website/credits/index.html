A quick message from me to you.




Never listen to those who try to make you feel sad.


Never care for those who make you feel bad.


Never give importance to those who hate you.


Don't care for others more than you care about yourself.


It's not selfish. Just give yourself the attention you need.


Those who say that you're not supposed to be here are wrong.


Those who hate you for being you are wrong.


You're not bad for being who you are.


Those who don't care about how others might feel about what they are doing or saying.


Those are the bad ones.


Those who never accept that everyone is different.


Those are the bad ones.


Those who never let you express yourself and embrace who you are.


Those are the bad ones.




Never be ashamed of who you are.


Never give up on what you always wanted.


Never give up on your friends who cared for you.




Everyone is a human, a person.


Everyone is important.


We all go through tough times.


We all make mistakes.


We're all not perfect.


We're all different.


Yet, we're all the same.




Just remember,

                                    be nice and think about what you say.
